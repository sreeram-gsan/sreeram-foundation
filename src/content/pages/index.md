Hello! I am a Master's student at CU Boulder pursuing Computer Science. Before joining CU, I worked as a Software Engineer at Oracle for 3.5 years. 

I have experience in architecting and developing enterprise-level applications. Cloud Computing, Systems Design and Backend Development are my areas of interest.
