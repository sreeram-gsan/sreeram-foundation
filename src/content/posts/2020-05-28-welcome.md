Hello,

Thanks for dropping by. For a very long time, I wanted to start a blog to write my thoughts and finally here it is. I am a strong believer in the idea that writing or teaching a topic is a good way to become an expert at it. This is the intent behind starting this blog where I can write about the things I learn and explore depth wise. My posts will be from the following topics

* Java
* Containers
* Programming concepts
* Linux
* Relational DB, etc

Stay tuned :)
